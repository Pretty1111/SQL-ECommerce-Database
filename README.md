## Features
- **Normalized Database Schema:** Tables for products, genres, users, transactions, and more, with appropriate relations.
- **Complex SQL Queries:** Includes procedures, joins, and data manipulation for insightful data retrieval.
- **Automated ETL Pipeline:** Python scripts for extracting data from web sources, transforming, and loading it into MySQL.
- **Web Scraping:** Utilising `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to extract book data from an online store.

## Technologies Used
- MySQL
- Python
- Libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup, mysql.connector

## How to Run
1. Set up a MySQL server and create a database using the provided SQL script.
2. Run the Python ETL script to populate the database with data extracted from the web.
3. Use the SQL queries provided to explore and manipulate the database.

## ETL Process and Jupyter Notebook
A comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is integral to this project, showcasing the efficient handling and integration of data into the database. A detailed Jupyter Notebook is included, demonstrating each step of the ETL process using Python. This notebook provides a practical example of Python's capabilities in data processing, from web scraping to database insertion, making it an invaluable resource for understanding the project's data management workflow.
